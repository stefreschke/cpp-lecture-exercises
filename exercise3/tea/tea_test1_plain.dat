Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy
lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green
planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a
pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for
pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely
concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't
the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the
ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees
in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have
left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying
how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew
how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one
would have to get nailed to anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe
occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
This is not her story.
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy - not an Earth book,
never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of
Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard either.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one - more popular than the
Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more
controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some
More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's
Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge
and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly
inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.
First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters
on its cover.
But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the
story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very
simply.
It begins with a house.




The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its own and looked over a
broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means - it was about thirty years
old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which
more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only
because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had
moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark haired
and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always
used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used
to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of his friends
worked in advertising.
It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an
bypass instead.
At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up,
wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to
the bathroom to wash.
Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub.
Shaving mirror - pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer
through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles. He shaved them off,
washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth.
Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn.
The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with.
The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.
He stared at it.
"Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed.
Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he
was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must
have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. "Yellow," he thought and stomped on to the bedroom.
He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry
about something that seemed important. He'd been telling people about it, telling people about it at great
length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces.
Something about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no
one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he'd
decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn't have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out.
God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror.
He stuck out his tongue. "Yellow," he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of
something to connect with.
Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was
advancing up his garden path.
Mr L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based life form descended
from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously
enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though
intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid
characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced
stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats.
He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man. Today he was
particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job - which was to
see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day was out.
"Come off it, Mr Dent,", he said, "you can't win you know. You can't lie in front of the bulldozer
indefinitely." He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it.
Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.
"I'm game," he said, "we'll see who rusts first."
"I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it," said Mr Prosser gripping his fur hat and rolling it round
the top of his head, "this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!"
"First I've heard of it," said Arthur, "why's it going to be built?"
Mr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again.
"What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a bypass. You've got to build bypasses."
Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point B very fast whilst other
people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in
between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen
to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there. They
often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be.
Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient
point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes
over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His
wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't know why - he just liked axes. He
flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously
somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him.
Mr Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time you
know."
"Appropriate time?" hooted Arthur. "Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman
arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd come to
demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and
charged me a fiver. Then he told me."
"But Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine month."
"Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't
exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or
anything."
"But the plans were on display ..."
"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them."
"That's the display department."
"With a torch."
"Ah, well the lights had probably gone."
"So had the stairs."
"But look, you found the notice didn't you?"
"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a
disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard."
A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the
cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent's house. Mr Prosser frowned at it.
"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house," he said.
"I'm sorry, but I happen to like it."
"You'll like the bypass."
"Oh shut up," said Arthur Dent. "Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You
haven't got a leg to stand on and you know it."
Mr Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with
inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur
himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.
Mr Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a
moment and then pulled himself together.
"Mr Dent," he said.
"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur.
"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if
I just let it roll straight over you?"
"How much?" said Arthur.
"None at all," said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a
thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.
By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur
Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small
planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.
This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked
hard to blend himself into Earth society - with, it must be said, some success. For instance he had spent
those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research. The
information he had gathered had led him to choose the name "Ford Prefect" as being nicely inconspicuous.
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome. His hair was
wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from
the nose. There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps
it was that his eyes didn't blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes
began involuntarily to water on his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave
people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one -- an
unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly
drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until
someone asked him what he was doing. Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.
"Oh, just looking for flying saucers," he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort
of flying saucers he was looking for.
"Green ones!" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment and then suddenly lunge for
the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks.
Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner
with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't matter
that much really.
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if
they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would usually say something like, "Don't you think it's
about time you went off home sir?"
"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to," is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions.
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into the night sky was any kind
of flying saucer at all. The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the
Betelgeuse trading scouts.
Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a
long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.
Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down
and get lifts from them. He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a
day.
In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The Hitch Hiker's Guide to
the Galaxy.
Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur's house had settled
into a steady routine. It was Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands
to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the
occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked
My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and
it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union
regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage.
The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.
The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.
A shadow moved across him again.
"Hello Arthur," said the shadow.
Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him.
"Ford! Hello, how are you?"
"Fine," said Ford, "look, are you busy?"
"Am I busy?" exclaimed Arthur. "Well, I've just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of
because they'll knock my house down if I don't, but other than that ... well, no not especially, why?"
They don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was
concentrating. He said, "Good, is there anywhere we can talk?"
"What?" said Arthur Dent.
For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get
run over by a car. Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur.
"We've got to talk," he said urgently.
"Fine," said Arthur, "talk."
"And drink," said Ford. "It's vitally important that we talk and drink. Now. We'll go to the pub in the
village."
He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.
"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. "That man wants to knock my
house down!"
Ford glanced at him, puzzled.
"Well he can do it while you're away can't he?" he asked.
"But I don't want him to!"
"Ah."
"Look, what's the matter with you Ford?" said Arthur.
"Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me - I've got to tell you the most important thing you've ever
heard. I've got to tell you now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom."
"But why?"
"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink."
Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his will was beginning to weaken. He didn't
realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that
served the madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta.
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this:
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them.
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in that ancient Orion mining
song "Oh don't give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none more of that Old
Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one
more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit").
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour
spirit into the glass of his opponent - who would then have to drink it.
The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played again. And again.
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Janx spirit is to
depress telepsychic power.
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a
forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.
Ford Prefect usually played to lose.
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse and Groom after
all.
"But what about my house ...?" he asked plaintively.
Ford looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him.
"He wants to knock your house down?"
"Yes, he wants to build ..."
"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers?"
"Yes, and ..."
"I'm sure we can come to some arrangement," said Ford. "Excuse me!" he shouted.
Mr Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not Arthur
Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. He
was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had company.
"Yes? Hello?" he called. "Has Mr Dent come to his senses yet?"
"Can we for the moment," called Ford, "assume that he hasn't?"
"Well?" sighed Mr Prosser.
"And can we also assume," said Ford, "that he's going to be staying here all day?"
"So?"
"So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?"
"Could be, could be ..."
"Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't actually need him to lie here all the time do
you?"
"What?"
"You don't," said Ford patiently, "actually need him here."
Mr Prosser thought about this.
"Well no, not as such...", he said, "not exactly need ..." Prosser was worried. He thought that one of
them wasn't making a lot of sense.
Ford said, "So if you would just like to take it as read that he's actually here, then he and I could slip off
down to the pub for half an hour. How does that sound?"
Mr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.
"That sounds perfectly reasonable," he said in a reassuring tone of voice, wondering who he was trying to
reassure.
"And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on," said Ford, "we can always cover up for you
in return."
"Thank you very much," said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how to play this at all, "thank you very
much, yes, that's very kind ..." He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold
of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head. He could only assume that he had just won.
"So," continued Ford Prefect, "if you would just like to come over here and lie down ..."
"What?" said Mr Prosser.
"Ah, I'm sorry," said Ford, "perhaps I hadn't made myself fully clear. Somebody's got to lie in front of
the bulldozers haven't they? Or there won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr Dent's house will
there?"
"What?" said Mr Prosser again.
"It's very simple," said Ford, "my client, Mr Dent, says that he will stop lying here in the mud on the sole
condition that you come and take over from him."
"What are you talking about?" said Arthur, but Ford nudged him with his shoe to be quiet.
"You want me," said Mr Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, "to come and lie there ..."
"Yes."
"In front of the bulldozer?"
"Yes."
"Instead of Mr Dent."
"Yes."
"In the mud."
"In, as you say it, the mud."
As soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted
itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed.
"In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down to the pub?"
"That's it," said Ford. "That's it exactly."
Mr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped.
"Promise?"
"Promise," said Ford. He turned to Arthur.
"Come on," he said to him, "get up and let the man lie down."
Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.
Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud. He felt that his whole life was
some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it. The mud
folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes.
Ford looked at him severely.
"And no sneaky knocking down Mr Dent's house whilst he's away, alright?" he said.
"The mere thought," growled Mr Prosser, "hadn't even begun to speculate," he continued, settling
himself back, "about the merest possibility of crossing my mind."
He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his
eyes. He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health
hazard himself. He was far from certain about this - his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and
the stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon, and he had never been
able to explain it to himself. In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed
with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered. He began to fell little pricks of water
behind the eyelids. Bureaucratic cock-ups, angry men lying in the mud, indecipherable strangers handing
out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head - what a day.
What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of dingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house
got knocked down or not now.
Arthur remained very worried.
"But can we trust him?" he said.
"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth," said Ford.
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "and how far's that?"
"About twelve minutes away," said Ford, "come on, I need a drink."




Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It says that alcohol is a colourless
volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbonbased
life forms.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says that the best drink in existence is
the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.
It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of
lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.
The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you
can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards.
The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself.
Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit, it says.
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V
- Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santraginean fish!!!
Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine
is lost).
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have
died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.
Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the
heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic.
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns
deep into the heart of the drink.
Sprinkle Zamphuor.
Add an olive.
Drink ... but ... very carefully ...
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia Galactica.
"Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and Groom. "And quickly please, the
world's about to end."
The barman of the Horse and Groom didn't deserve this sort of treatment, he was a dignified old man.
He pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared out of the
window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who shrugged helplessly and said nothing.
So the barman said, "Oh yes sir? Nice weather for it," and started pulling pints.
He tried again.
"Going to watch the match this afternoon then?"
Ford glanced round at him.
"No, no point," he said, and looked back out of the window.
"What's that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir?" said the barman. "Arsenal without a chance?"
"No, no," said Ford, "it's just that the world's about to end."
"Oh yes sir, so you said," said the barman, looking over his glasses this time at Arthur. "Lucky
escape for Arsenal if it did."
Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised.
"No, not really," he said. He frowned.
The barman breathed in heavily. "There you are sir, six pints," he said.
Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just
in case any of them had heard what was going on.
None of them had, and none of them could understand what he was smiling at them for.
A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of
mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them.
"Get off," said Ford, "They're ours," giving him a look that would have an Algolian Suntiger get on with
what it was doing.
Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar. He said, "Keep the change."
"What, from a fiver? Thank you sir."
"You've got ten minutes left to spend it."
The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit.
"Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the hell is going on?"
"Drink up," said Ford, "you've got three pints to get through."
"Three pints?" said Arthur. "At lunchtime?"
The man next to ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored him. He said, "Time is an illusion.
Lunchtime doubly so."
"Very deep," said Arthur, "you should send that in to the Reader's Digest. They've got a page for
people like you."
"Drink up."
"Why three pints all of a sudden?"
"Muscle relaxant, you'll need it."
"Muscle relaxant?"
"Muscle relaxant."
Arthur stared into his beer.
"Did I do anything wrong today," he said, "or has the world always been like this and I've been too
wrapped up in myself to notice?"
"Alright," said Ford, "I'll try to explain. How long have we known each other?"
"How long?" Arthur thought. "Er, about five years, maybe six," he said. "Most of it seemed to make some
sense at the time."
"Alright," said Ford. "How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all, but from a
small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?"
Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way.
"I don't know," he said, taking a pull of beer. "Why - do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to
say?"
Ford gave up. It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment, what with the world being about to end.
He just said:
"Drink up."
He added, perfectly factually:
"The world's about to end."
Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of the pub frowned at him. A man waved at
him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business.
"This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low over his beer, "I never could get the
hang of Thursdays."




On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above
the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike
somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds. They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays
from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.
The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they
wanted it for the moment. The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape
Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them - which was a pity
because it was exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years.
The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which
winked away quietly to itself. It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect wore
habitually round his neck. The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would
have made any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping
a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top. Besides the
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb - a short squat black rod, smooth and
matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a
largish electronic calculator. This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four
inches square on which any one of a million "pages" could be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked
insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words
Don't Panic printed on it in large friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that most
remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor - The Hitch
Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic
component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would require several
inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in.
Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks
and Spencer.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels.
A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it
has great practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of
Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady
sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon;
use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it
round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal
(a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very
ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off
with it if it still seems to be clean enough.
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch
hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in
possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray,
wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of
these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is
that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible
odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in "Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford
Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex
with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.)
Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink
more quickly. Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At Jodrell
Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea.
"You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.
Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.
"Why? What, no ... should I have?" He had given up being surprised, there didn't seem to be any
point any longer.
Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.
"Drink up," he urged.
At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the
pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky
Ford had eventually bought him.
Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.
"What's that?" he yelped.
"Don't worry," said Ford, "they haven't started yet."
"Thank God for that," said Arthur and relaxed.
"It's probably just your house being knocked down," said Ford, drowning his last pint.
"What?" shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford's spell was broken. Arthur looked wildly around him and ran to
the window.
"My God they are! They're knocking my house down. What the hell am I doing in the pub, Ford?"
"It hardly makes any difference at this stage," said Ford, "let them have their fun."
"Fun?" yelped Arthur. "Fun!" He quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the
same thing.
"Damn their fun!" he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass. He
made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime.
"Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!" bawled Arthur. "You half crazed Visigoths, stop will you!"
Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts.
"There you are sir," said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, "twenty-eight pence if you'd be so
kind."
Ford was very kind - he gave the barman another five-pound note and told him to keep the change. The
barman looked at it and then looked at Ford. He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation
that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before. In moments of great
stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This signal simply communicates an
exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never
possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn't very far, so such
signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born
600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse.
The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense of distance. He didn't
know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe.
"Are you serious, sir?" he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub. "You think
the world's going to end?"
"Yes," said Ford.
"But, this afternoon?"
Ford had recovered himself. He was at his flippest.
"Yes," he said gaily, "in less than two minutes I would estimate."
The barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn't believe the sensation he had
just had either.
"Isn't there anything we can do about it then?" he said.
"No, nothing," said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets.
Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become.
The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes waved their way up to Ford.
"I thought," he said, "that if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over
our head or something."
"If you like, yes," said Ford.
"That's what they told us in the army," said the man, and his eyes began the long trek back down to his
whisky.
"Will that help?" asked the barman.
"No," said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. "Excuse me," he said, "I've got to go." With a wave, he
left.
The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous
laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over
the last hour or so, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a
half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. However,
when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it.
The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say:
"Last orders, please."
The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move faster.
Ford knew they were there. This wasn't the way he had wanted it.
Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He didn't notice how cold it had suddenly
become, he didn't notice the wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain. He didn't notice
anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home.
"You barbarians!" he yelled. "I'll sue the council for every penny it's got! I'll have you hung, drawn
and quartered! And whipped! And boiled ... until ... until ... until you've had enough."
Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast.
"And then I'll do it again!" yelled Arthur. "And when I've finished I will take all the little bits, and I
will jump on them!"
Arthur didn't notice that the men were running from the
bulldozers; he didn't notice that Mr Prosser was staring
hectically into the sky. What Mr Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were
screaming through the clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings.
"And I will carry on jumping on them," yelled Arthur, still running, "until I get blisters, or I can think
of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then ..."
Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back. At last he noticed that something was
going on. His finger shot upwards.
"What the hell's that?" he shrieked.
Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with mind-buggering
noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears
six feet into your skull.
Another one followed and did the same thing only louder.
It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they
didn't really know what they were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense - running into houses,
running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise. All around the world city streets exploded with
people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and
valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit.
Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in
his ears. He knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic had
started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start. It was what he had waited
for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his small dark room a
coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart. Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come
and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the Vogons.
Still he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he
opened his satchel. He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw
away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was going. Everything was ready, everything was
prepared.
He knew where his towel was.
A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the noise. For a while nothing happened.
The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on Earth. Motionless they hung, huge,
heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as their minds
tried to encompass what they were looking at. The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks
don't.
And still nothing happened.
Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound. Every hi fi set in
the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every midrange
driver in the world quietly turned itself on.
Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal
became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board.
Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the
greatest public address system ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple
message.
"People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it was wonderful. Wonderful perfect
quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.
"This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council," the voice continued.
"As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the
building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of
those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes. Thank
you."
The PA died away.
Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth. The terror moved slowly through the
gathered crowds as if they were iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them.
Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was nowhere to flee to.
Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said:
"There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts and demolition orders have
been on display in your local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so
you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it
now."
The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land. The huge ships turned slowly in the sky
with easy power. On the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space.
By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and
broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever heard what
they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammed back into life again. The voice was annoyed. It said:
"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven's sake mankind, it's only four
light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's
your own lookout.
"Energize the demolition beams."
Light poured out into the hatchways.
"I don't know," said the voice on the PA, "apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all." It cut off.
There was a terrible ghastly silence.
There was a terrible ghastly noise.
There was a terrible ghastly silence.
The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void.




Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred thousand light years from the star
Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of
Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun.
Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of. Damogran, secret
home of the Heart of Gold.
The boat sped on across the water. It would be some time before it reached its destination because
Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet. It consists of nothing but middling to large
desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean.
The boat sped on.
Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always remained a deserted planet. This is
why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so
deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret.
The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only
archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny
spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence - in Galacticspeke, easter
means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence
was called France.
One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless
coincidences.
But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day
of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was
also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had first
decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the
Imperial Galaxy - Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President?
Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas.
Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.
Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self-publicist,
terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.
President?
No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.
Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and
they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less
a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency fodder*.
What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it.
He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.
Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod had been up to. Today
was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's Presidency was all about. Today was also his two hundredth birthday,
but that was just another meaningless coincidence.
As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a
wonderful exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the seat back. He
steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing.
"Hey," he cooed to himself, "you're a real cool boy you." But his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog
whistle.
The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across the middle, sandy and crescent
shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining
the sweep and curve of a huge bay. This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of
the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs. From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down
five miles to the opposite shore.
On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee.
It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold - mostly
humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph-like
maximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a superintelligent
shade of the color blue). All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi-colored
ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the
occasion.
There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them. Together and between them they
had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter,
strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of
all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck. (An orange sash was what the
President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd
known exactly how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six people
in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention
away from it.
Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.
The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the Presidential speedboat zipped round the
headland into the bay. It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns.
In fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized
atoms - but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water. They
slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and sank
back foaming into the boat's wake as it careered across the bay.
Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at.
He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and
dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves.
Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion people. The three
billion people weren't actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot
tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made
amazingly popular tri-D; that's what they were for.
He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn't know it, but today would be a bigger antic than
anyone had bargained for.
The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two heads and he waved again.
He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled hair
stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his
chins were almost always unshaven.
A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the
brilliant sun. Inside it floated a wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the
globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all
done for effect as much as anything.
Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa. He spread his two arms lazily
along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he put
his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might scream.
Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble surged into the air, bobbing
and rolling on the water spout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff. Up it surged on the
jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.
Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.
A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one.
At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small
concave platform and riddled to a halt.
To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the
light.
The President of the Galaxy had arrived.
He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in greeting.
"Hi," he said.
A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his
hands. Pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the Damogran
sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested
Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had
invented. It was constructed largely of papier and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle
to break out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but
wanted no truck with it.
Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered
him by the spider.
"Hi," he said again.
Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled out Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was
a gird that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was slim,
darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and
ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky
brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab of course. The
Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand
light years from Damogran. Trillian wasn't anybody in particular, or so Zaphod claimed. She just went
around with him rather a lot and told him what she thought of him.
"Hi honey," he said to her.
She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she looked back for a moment and smiled
more warmly - but by this time he was looking at something else.
"Hi," he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he
would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a
few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote.
The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One of the officials of the party had
irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that
had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away in
front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle, split, and slowly
folded itself down into the ground. Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to
do that because they had built it that way.
Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running
shoe, perfectly white and mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which
carried within it the most brain-wretching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique
in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named - The Heart of Gold.
"Wow", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't much else he could say.
He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press.
"Wow."
The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He winked at Trillian who raised her
eyebrows and widened her eyes at him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible
showoff.
"That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing.
That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it."
A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The crowd laughed appreciatively, the
newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned.
As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled
quietly in his pocket.
Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds,
threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles.




Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons. His highly domed nose rose
high above a small piggy forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of
Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea
depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects.
Not that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule would not allow it. He was the way he was
because billions of years ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of
Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet's virgin shores... when the first rays of the
bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution ad simply
given up on them there and then, had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and
unfortunate mistake. They never evolved again; they should never have survived.
The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed slug-brained stubbornness of these
creatures. Evolution? they said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them they
simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with
surgery.
Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been working overtime to make up for
their earlier blunder. They brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate,
smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which
the Vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken coats and
dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They were no use as transport because their backs
would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway.
Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons suddenly discovered
the principles of interstellar travel. Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the
Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of
the Galactic Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to acquire style and
social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears.
Every year they import twenty-seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet
and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like
hitch hikers.
Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a
small match flared nervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and
was right to be nervous. His name was Ford Prefect*.
He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped
with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The
Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently
taken to employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they keep
themselves very much to themselves.
This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies
in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an
annoyed Vogon.
It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen,
ozone and carbon monoxide.
He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor.
Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. He
crouched on the floor. The shape moved again.
Ford Prefect said: "I bought some peanuts."
Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.
"Here, have some," urged Ford, shaking the packet again, "if you've never been through a matter
transference beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had should have
cushioned your system a bit."
"Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes.
"It's dark," he said.
"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "it's dark."
"No light," said Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light."
One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings was
their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or You're very tall, or
Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright? At first Ford had formed a
theory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought,
their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this
theory in favour of a new one. If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start
working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite
liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of
things they didn't know about.
"Yes," he agreed with Arthur, "no light." He helped Arthur to some peanuts. "How do you feel?" he
asked.
"Like a military academy," said Arthur, "bits of me keep on passing out."
Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness.
"If I asked you where the hell we were," said Arthur weakly, "would I regret it?"
Ford stood up. "We're safe," he said.
"Oh good," said Arthur.
"We're in a small galley cabin," said Ford, "in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet."
"Ah," said Arthur, "this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware
of."
Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed
again. Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes seemed to
throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying
themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing.
"How did we get here?" he asked, shivering slightly.
"We hitched a lift," said Ford.
"Excuse me?" said Arthur. "Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green
bug-eyed monster stuck his head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far as the Basingstoke
roundabout?"
"Well," said Ford, "the Thumb's an electronic sub-etha signalling device, the roundabout's at Barnard's
Star six light years away, but otherwise, that's more or less right."
"And the bug-eyed monster?"
"Is green, yes."
"Fine," said Arthur, "when can I get home?"
"You can't," said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch.
"Shade your eyes ..." he said, and turned it on.
Even Ford was surprised.
"Good grief," said Arthur, "is this really the interior of a flying saucer?"
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge. He always felt
vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets. He wished that someone would come and tell him that
it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better. He flopped as heavily as he could on to his
control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry about, but it
only gave a complaining sort of creak.
"Go away!" he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge at that moment. The guard
vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved. He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered the report
they'd just received. The report was an official release which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship
drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran which would
henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes unnecessary.
Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't shout because it was the door from the
galley quarters where the Dentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome.
A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray. It was grinning like a maniac.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself
there was something going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about.
Ford and Arthur stared about them.
"Well, what do you think?" said Ford.
"It's a bit squalid, isn't it?"
Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien
underwear that lay around the cramped cabin.
"Well, this is a working ship, you see," said Ford. "These are the Dentrassi sleeping quarters."
"I thought you said they were called Vogons or something."
"Yes," said Ford, "the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks, they let us on board."
"I'm confused," said Arthur.
"Here, have a look at this," said Ford. He sat down on one of the mattresses and rummaged about in his
satchel. Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be
nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed
and dried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to life again.
Ford handed the book to Arthur.
"What is it?" asked Arthur.
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic book. It tells you everything you need to
know about anything. That's its job."
Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands.
"I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all
day."
"I'll show you how it works," said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur who was still holding it as if it was
a two-week-dead lark and pulled it out of its cover.
"You press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving you the index."
A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to flicker across the surface.
"You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so." His fingers tapped some more keys. "And
there we are."
The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen.
Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it. At
the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice. This is what the book
said.
"Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it. They
are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy -- not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic,
officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous
Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found,
subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat and recycled as firelighters.
"The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to
irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you."
Arthur blinked at it.
"What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?"
"That's the point, it's out of date now," said Ford, sliding the book back into its cover. "I'm doing the field
research for the New Revised Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include is a bit about how the
Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather useful little loophole."
A pained expression crossed Arthur's face. "But who are the Dentrassi?" he said.
"Great guys," said Ford. "They're the best cooks and the best drink mixers and they don't give a wet slap
about anything else. And they'll always help hitch hikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but
mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you're an
impoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a
day. And that's my job. Fun, isn't it?"
Arthur looked lost.
"It's amazing," he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses.
"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended," said Ford. "I came for a
week and got stuck for fifteen years."
"But how did you get there in the first place then?"
"Easy, I got a lift with a teaser."
"A teaser?"
"Yeah."
"Er, what is ..."
"A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They cruise around looking for planets which
haven't made interstellar contact yet and buzz them."
"Buzz them?" Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life difficult for him.
"Yeah", said Ford, "they buzz them. They find some isolated spot with very few people around, then
land right by some poor soul whom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him
wearing silly antennae on their heads and making beep beep noises. Rather childish really." Ford leant back
on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with himself.
"Ford," insisted Arthur, "I don't know if this sounds like a silly question, but what am I doing here?"
"Well you know that," said Ford. "I rescued you from the Earth."
"And what's happened to the Earth?"
"Ah. It's been demolished."
"Has it," said Arthur levelly.
"Yes. It just boiled away into space."
"Look," said Arthur, "I'm a bit upset about that."
Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his mind.
"Yes, I can understand that," he said at last.
"Understand that!" shouted Arthur. "Understand that!"
Ford sprang up.
"Keep looking at the book!" he hissed urgently.
"What?"
"Don't Panic."
"I'm not panicking!"
"Yes you are."
"Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do?"
"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a fun place. You'll need to have this
fish in your ear."
"I beg your pardon?" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought.
Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish wriggling around in it.
Arthur blinked at him. He wished there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of. He
would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the piles of Squornshellous mattresses and the
man from Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had been able to see
just a small packet of corn flakes. He couldn't, and he didn't feel safe.
Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he could identify. He gasped in terror at
what sounded like a man trying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves.
"Shush!" said Ford. "Listen, it might be important."
"Im ... important?"
"It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy."
"You mean that's how the Vogons talk?"
"Listen!"
"But I can't speak Vogon!"
"You don't need to. Just put that fish in your ear."
Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's ear, and he had the sudden sickening
sensation of the fish slithering deep into his aural tract. Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a
second or so, but then slowly turned goggle-eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalent of
looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white
candlestick. Or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which suddenly resolve
themselves into the figure six and mean that your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a
new pair of glasses.
He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only now it had taken on the semblance of
perfectly straightforward English.
This is what he heard ...




"Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl
gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a good time. Message repeats. This is your captain
speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention. First of all I see from our instruments that we
have a couple of hitchhikers aboard. Hello wherever you are. I just want to make it totally clear that you are
not at all welcome. I worked hard to get where I am today, and I didn't become captain of a Vogon
constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders. I have sent
out a search party, and as soon that they find you I will put you off the ship. If you're very lucky I might read
you some of my poetry first.
"Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to Barnard's Star. On arrival we will
stay in dock for a seventy-two hour refit, and no one's to leave the ship during that time. I repeat, all planet
leave is cancelled. I've just had an unhappy love affair, so I don't see why anybody else should have a good
time. Message ends."
The noise stopped.
Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his
arms wrapped round his head. He smiled weakly.
"Charming man," he said. "I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one ..."
"You wouldn't need to," said Ford. "They've got as much sex appeal as a road accident. No, don't
move," he added as Arthur began to uncurl himself, "you'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace.
It's unpleasantly like being drunk."
"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?"
"You ask a glass of water."
Arthur thought about this.
"Ford," he said.
"Yeah?"
"What's this fish doing in my ear?"
"It's translating for you. It's a Babel fish. Look it up in the book if you like."
He tossed over The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then curled himself up into a foetal ball to
prepare himself for the jump.
At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind.
His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head.
The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own
navel.
They were passing through hyperspace.
"The Babel fish," said The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy quietly, "is small, yellow and leechlike,
and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but
from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to
nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining
the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which
has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can
instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear
decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.
"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindboggingly useful could have
evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the
non-existence of God.
"The argument goes something like this: `I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, `for proof denies faith,
and without faith I am nothing.'
"`But,' says Man, `The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It
proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.'
"`Oh dear,' says God, `I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic.
"`Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets
himself killed on the next zebra crossing.
"Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop
Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book Well
That About Wraps It Up For God.
"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between
different races and cultures, has caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the history of
creation."
Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the kick through hyperspace hadn't killed
him. He was now six light years from the place that the Earth would have been if it still existed.
The Earth.
Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There was no way his imagination could
feel the impact of the whole Earth having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that his
parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction.
Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the supermarket
before and felt a sudden stab - the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone. Nelson's Column
had gone! Nelson's Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was no one left to
make an outcry. From now on Nelson's Column only existed in his mind. England only existed in his
mind - his mind, stuck here in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia closed in
on him.
England no longer existed. He'd got that - somehow he'd got it. He tried again. America, he thought, has
gone. He couldn't grasp it. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He'd never
seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every
Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought.
There is no longer any such thing as a McDonald's hamburger.
He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was sobbing for his mother.
He jerked himself violently to his feet.
"Ford!"
Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to himself. He always found the actual
travelling-through-space part of space travel rather trying.
"Yeah?" he said.
"If you're a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth, you must have been gathering material on
it."
"Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes."
"Let me see what it says in this edition then, I've got to see it."
"Yeah OK." He passed it over again.
Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. He pressed the entry for the relevant page.
The screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it.
"It doesn't have an entry!" he burst out.
Ford looked over his shoulder.
"Yes it does," he said, "down there, see at the bottom of the screen, just under Eccentrica Gallumbits,
the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6."
Arthur followed Ford's finger, and saw where it was pointing. For a moment it still didn't register, then his
mind nearly blew up.
"What? Harmless? Is that all it's got to say? Harmless! One word!"
Ford shrugged.
"Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only a limited amount of space in the book's
microprocessors," he said, "and no one knew much about the Earth of course."
"Well for God's sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit."
"Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor. He had to trim it a bit, but it's still an
improvement."
"And what does it say now?" asked Arthur.
"Mostly harmless," admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough.
"Mostly harmless!" shouted Arthur.
"What was that noise?" hissed Ford.
"It was me shouting," shouted Arthur.
"No! Shut up!" said Ford. I think we're in trouble."
"You think we're in trouble!"
Outside the door were the sounds of marching feet.
"The Dentrassi?" whispered Arthur.
"No, those are steel tipped boots," said Ford.
There was a sharp ringing rap on the door.
"Then who is it?" said Arthur.
"Well," said Ford, "if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to throw us in to space."
"And if we're unlucky?"
"If we're unlucky," said Ford grimly, "the captain might be serious in his threat that he's going to
read us some of his poetry first ..."




Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.
The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos
the Flatulent of his poem "Ode To A Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer
Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic
Arts
Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been
"disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve-book epic
entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save
life and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain.
The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of
Greenbridge, Essex, England in the destruction of the planet Earth.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying
to remember the sequence of muscle movements. He had had a terribly therapeutic yell at his prisoners and
was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little callousness.
The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs --strapped in. Vogons suffered no illusions as to the
regard their works were generally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been part of bludgeoning
insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved and cultured race, but now the only thing that kept
them going was sheer bloodymindedness.
The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round the electrodes strapped to his temples.
These were attached to a battery of electronic equipment - imagery intensifiers, rhythmic modulators,
alliterative residulators and simile dumpers - all designed to heighten the experience of the poem and make
sure that not a single nuance of the poet's thought was lost.
Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for, but he knew that he hadn't liked
anything that had happened so far and didn't think things were likely to change.
The Vogon began to read - a fetid little passage of his own devising.
"Oh frettled gruntbuggly ..." he began. Spasms wracked Ford's body - this was worse than ever he'd been
prepared for.
"... thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee."
"Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!" went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head back as lumps of pain thumped through
it. He could dimly see beside him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his teeth.
"Groop I implore thee," continued the merciless Vogon, "my foonting turlingdromes."
His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned
stridency. "And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly
bindlewurdles,| Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!"
"Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford Prefect and threw one final spasm as
the electronic enhancement of the last line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp.
Arthur lolled.
"Now Earthlings ..." whirred the Vogon (he didn't know that Ford Prefect was in fact from a small
planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and wouldn't have cared if he had) "I present you with a simple choice!
Either die in the vacuum of space, or ..." he paused for melodramatic effect, "tell me how good you thought
my poem was!"
He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat-shaped seat and watched them. He did the smile
again.
Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his parched mouth and moaned.
Arthur said brightly: "Actually I quite liked it."
Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simply not occurred to him.
The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his nose and was therefore no bad thing.
"Oh good ..." he whirred, in considerable astonishment.
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly effective."
Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts around this totally new concept. Were
they really going to be able to bareface their way out of this?
"Yes, do continue ..." invited the Vogon.
"Oh ... and er ... interesting rhythmic devices too," continued Arthur, "which seemed to counterpoint the
... er ... er ..." He floundered.
Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the ... er
..." He floundered too, but Arthur was ready again.
"... humanity of the ..."
"Vogonity," Ford hissed at him.
"Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet's compassionate soul,"
Arthur felt he was on a home stretch now, "which contrives
through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this,
transcend that, and come to terms with the fundamental
dichotomies of the other," (he was reaching a triumphant
crescendo ...) "and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into ... into ... er ..." (... which suddenly
gave out on him.)
Ford leaped in with the coup de grace:
"Into whatever it was the poem was about!" he yelled. Out of the corner of his mouth: "Well done, Arthur,
that was very good."
The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul had been touched, but he thought no
- too little too late. His voice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon.
"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I
really just want to be loved," he said. He paused. "Is that right?"
Ford laughed a nervous laugh. "Well I mean yes," he said, "don't we all, deep down, you know ... er ..."
The Vogon stood up.
"No, well you're completely wrong," he said, "I just write poetry to throw my mean callous heartless
exterior into sharp relief. I'm going to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard! Take the prisoners to
number three airlock and throw them out!"
"What?" shouted Ford.
A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery
arms.
"You can't throw us into space," yelled Ford, "we're trying to write a book."
"Resistance is useless!" shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It was the first phrase he'd learnt when he
joined the Vogon Guard Corps.
The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away.
Arthur stared round him wildly.
"I don't want to die now!" he yelled. "I've still got a headache! I don't want to go to heaven with a
headache, I'd be all cross and wouldn't enjoy it!"
The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing deferentially towards his captain's
back, hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain was on his own
again. He hummed quietly and mused to himself, lightly fingering his notebook of verses.
"Hmmmm," he said, "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor ..." He considered this for
a moment, and then closed the book with a grim smile.
"Death's too good for them," he said.
The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two humanoids clamped firmly under
rubbery Vogon armpits.
"This is great," spluttered Arthur, "this is really terrific. Let go of me you brute!"
The Vogon guard dragged them on.
"Don't you worry," said Ford, "I'll think of something." He didn't sound hopeful.
"Resistance is useless!" bellowed the guard.
"Just don't say things like that," stammered Ford. "How can anyone maintain a positive mental
attitude if you're saying things like that?"
"My God," complained Arthur, "you're talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even
had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit
of reading, brush the dog ... It's now just after four in the afternoon and I'm already thrown out of an alien
spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!" He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon
tightened his grip.
"Alright," said Ford, "just stop panicking."
"Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Arthur. "This is still just the culture shock. You wait
till I've settled down into the situation and found my bearings. Then I'll start panicking."
"Arthur you're getting hysterical. Shut up!" Ford tried desperately to think, but was interrupted by
the guard shouting again.
"Resistance is useless!"
"And you can shut up as well!" snapped Ford.
"Resistance is useless!"
"Oh give it a rest," said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captor's face. A
thought struck him.
"Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?" he asked suddenly.
The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over his face.
"Enjoy?" he boomed. "What do you mean?"
"What I mean," said Ford, "is does it give you a full satisfying
life? Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships
..."
The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled over each other. His
mouth slacked. Finally he said, "Well the hours are good ..."
"They'd have to be," agreed Ford.
Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford.
"Ford, what are you doing?" he asked in an amazed whisper.
"Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?" he said. "So the hours are pretty good
then?" he resumed.
The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths.
"Yeah," he said, "but now you come to mention it, most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy. Except
..." he thought again, which required looking at the ceiling - "except some of the shouting I quite like."
He filled his lungs and bellowed, "Resistance is ..."
"Sure, yes," interrupted Ford hurriedly, "you're good at that, I can tell. But if it's mostly lousy," he said,
slowly giving the words time to reach their mark, "then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The
leather? The machismo? Or do you just find that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents
an interesting challenge?"
"Er ..." said the guard, "er ... er ... I dunno. I think I just sort of ... do it really. My aunt said that spaceship
guard was a good career for a young Vogon - you know, the uniform, the low-slung stun ray holster, the
mindless tedium ..."
"There you are Arthur," said Ford with the air of someone reaching the conclusion of his argument,
"you think you've got problems."
Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business with his home planet the Vogon
guard had half-throttled him already and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space very much.
"Try and understand his problem," insisted Ford. "Here he is poor lad, his entire life's work is stamping
around, throwing people off spaceships ..."
"And shouting," added the guard.
"And shouting, sure," said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round his neck in friendly
condescension, "... and he doesn't even know why he's doing it!"
Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble gesture, because he was too asphyxicated
to speak.
Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard.
"Well. Now you put it like that I suppose ..."
"Good lad!" encouraged Ford.
"But alright," went on the rumblings, "so what's the alternative?"
"Well," said Ford, brightly but slowly, "stop doing it of course! Tell them," he went on, "you're not going
to do it anymore." He felt he had to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have
his mind occupied pondering that much.
"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ..." said the guard, "erm, well that doesn't sound that
great to me."
Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away.
"Now wait a minute," he said, "that's just the start you see, there's more to it than that you see ..."
But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original purpose of lugging his
prisoners to the airlock. He was obviously quite touched.
"No, I think if it's all the same to you," he said, "I'd better get you both shoved into this airlock and then
go and get on with some other bits of shouting I've got to do."
It wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect after all.
"Come on now ... but look!" he said, less slowly, less brightly.
"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn ..." said Arthur without any clear inflection.
"But hang on," pursued Ford, "there's music and art and things to tell you about yet! Arrrggghhh!"
"Resistance is useless," bellowed the guard, and then added, "You see if I keep it up I can eventually
get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non-shouting and
non-pushing-people-about officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I know."
They had now reached the airlock - a large circular steel hatchway of massive strength and weight let
into the inner skin of the craft. The guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open.
"But thanks for taking an interest," said the Vogon guard. "Bye now." He flung Ford and Arthur
through the hatchway into the small chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled
round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway.
"But listen," he shouted to the guard, "there's a whole world you don't know anything about ... here how
about this?" Desperately he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand - he hummed the first bar
of Beethoven's Fifth.
"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?"
"No," said the guard, "not really. But I'll mention it to my aunt."
If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but
the faint distant hum of the ship's engines.
They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diameter and ten feet long.
"Potentially bright lad I thought," he said and slumped against the curved wall.
Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen. He didn't look up. He just lay
panting.
"We're trapped now aren't we?"
"Yes," said Ford, "we're trapped."
"Well didn't you think of anything? I thought you said you were going to think of something. Perhaps you
thought of something and didn't notice."
"Oh yes, I thought of something," panted Ford. Arthur looked up expectantly.
"But unfortunately," continued Ford, "it rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway."
He kicked the hatch they'd just been through.
"But it was a good idea was it?"
"Oh yes, very neat."
"What was it?"
"Well I hadn't worked out the details yet. Not much point now is there?"
"So ... er, what happens next?"
"Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few moments and we will shoot out
into deep space I expect and asphyxicate. If you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty
seconds of course ..." said Ford. He stuck his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum
an old Betelgeusian battle hymn. To Arthur's eyes he suddenly looked very alien.
"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die."
"Yes," said Ford, "except ... no! Wait a minute!" he suddenly lunged across the chamber at something
behind Arthur's line of vision. "What's this switch?" he cried.
"What? Where?" cried Arthur twisting round.
"No, I was only fooling," said Ford, "we are going to die after all."
He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he left off.
"You know," said Arthur, "it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from
Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxication in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my
mother told me when I was young."
"Why, what did she tell you?"
"I don't know, I didn't listen."
"Oh." Ford carried on humming.
"This is terrific," Arthur thought to himself, "Nelson's Column has gone, McDonald's have gone, all
that's left is me and the words Mostly Harmless. Any second now all that will be left is Mostly Harmless.
And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well."
A motor whirred.
A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatchway opened on to an empty
blackness studded with tiny impossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped into outer space like
corks from a toy gun.




The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It has been compiled and
recompiled many times over many years and under many different editorships. It contains contributions
from countless numbers of travellers and researchers.
The introduction begins like this: "Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly
hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's
just peanuts to space. Listen ..." and so on.
(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like
the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by
ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you
excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you leave: so every time you
go to the lavatory it is vitally important to get a receipt.)
To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances between the stars, better
minds than the one responsible for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some invite you to consider
for a moment a peanut in reading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.
The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination.
Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at
all, takes time to journey between the stars. It takes eight minutes from the star Sol to the place where the
Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol's nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.
For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for instance, takes rather longer:
five hundred thousand years.
The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five years, but you don't get to see much on the
way.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total
vacuum of space for about thirty seconds. However it goes on to say that what with space being the mind
boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the
power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against.
By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an Islington flat where Arthur
once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with - she went off
with a gatecrasher.
Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished, it is
comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine
seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued.




A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason.
This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch.
A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of
an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years from end to end.
As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe. A
team of seven three-foot-high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxication, partly of
surprise.
Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too, materializing in a large woobly
heap on the famine-struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system.
The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol
poisoning some weeks later.
The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in
a most improbable fashion. Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random
group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most
extraordinarily unlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves (this was part of what
was so extraordinary of the patterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on
to. That was how life began in the Universe.
Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed up a pavement.
On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half-spent fish.
"There you are," gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the pavement as it raced through the Third
Reach of the Unknown, "I told you I'd think of something."
"Oh sure," said Arthur, "sure."
"Bright idea of mine," said Ford, "to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it."
The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various pretend ones flitted silently by, like
mountain goats. Primal light exploded, splattering space-time as with gobbets of junket. Time blossomed,
matter shrank away. The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever.
"Oh come off it," said Arthur, "the chances against it were astronomical."
"Don't knock it, it worked," said Ford.
"What sort of ship are we in?" asked Arthur as the pit of eternity yawned beneath them.
"I don't know," said Ford, "I haven't opened my eyes yet."
"No, nor have I," said Arthur.
The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unexpected directions.
Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise.
"Good god," said Arthur, "it looks just like the sea front at Southend."
"Hell, I'm relieved to hear you say that," said Ford.
"Why?"
"Because I thought I must be going mad."
"Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it."
Ford thought about this.
"Well, did you say it or didn't you?" he asked.
"I think so," said Arthur.
"Well, perhaps we're both going mad."
"Yes," said Arthur, "we'd be mad, all things considered, to think this was Southend."
"Well, do you think this is Southend?"
"Oh yes."
"So do I."
"Therefore we must be mad."
"Nice day for it."
"Yes," said a passing maniac.
"Who was that?" asked Arthur
"Who - the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers?"
"Yes."
"I don't know. Just someone."
"Ah."
They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge children bounced heavily
along the sand and wild horses thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the
Uncertain Areas.
"You know," said Arthur with a slight cough, "if this is Southend, there's something very odd about it
..."
"You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep washing up and down?" said Ford. "Yes
I thought that was odd too. In fact," he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six equal
segments which danced and span giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formation, "there is
something altogether very strange going on."
Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot doughnuts popped out of the road
for ten pence each, horrid fish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for it.
They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought, valleys of mood music, bad
shoe sessions and footling bats and suddenly heard a girl's voice.
It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, "Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one
against and falling," and that was all.
Ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a source for the voice but could see
nothing he could seriously believe in.
"What was that voice?" shouted Arthur.
"I don't know," yelled Ford, "I don't know. It sounded like a measurement of probability."
"Probability? What do you mean?"
"Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to four against. It said two to the power of one
hundred thousand to one against. That's pretty improbable you know."
A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning.
"But what does it mean?" cried Arthur.
"What, the custard?"
"No, the measurement of probability!"
"I don't know. I don't know at all. I think we're on some kind of spaceship."
"I can only assume," said Arthur, "that this is not the first-class compartment."
Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time. Great ugly bulges.
"Haaaauuurrgghhh ..." said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions.
"Southend seems to be melting away ... the stars are swirling ... a dustbowl ... my legs are drifting off into
the sunset ... my left arm's come off too." A frightening thought struck him: "Hell," he said, "how am I going
to operate my digital watch now?" He wound his eyes desperately around in Ford's direction.
"Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it."
Again came the voice.
"Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and falling."
Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle.
"Hey, who are you," he quacked. "Where are you? What's going on and is there any way of stopping it?"
"Please relax," said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two
engines one of which is on fire, "you are perfectly safe."
"But that's not the point!" raged Ford. "The point is that I am now a perfectly save penguin, and my
colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!"
"It's alright, I've got them back now," said Arthur.
"Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling," said the voice.
"Admittedly," said Arthur, "they're longer than I usually like them, but ..."
"Isn't there anything," squawked Ford in avian fury, "you feel you ought to be telling us?"
The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off into the distance.
"Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold."
The voice continued.
"Please do not be alarmed," it said, "by anything you see or hear around you. You are bound to feel some
initial ill effects as you have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of
two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against - possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level
of two to the power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality
just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of twenty thousand to
one against and falling."
The voice cut out.
Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle.
Ford was wildly excited.
"Arthur!" he said, "this is fantastic! We've been picked up by a ship powered by the Infinite
Improbability Drive! This is incredible! I heard rumors about it before! They were all officially
denied, but they must have done it! They've built the Improbability Drive! Arthur, this is ... Arthur?
What's happening?"
Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying to hold it closed, but it was ill fitting.
Tiny furry little hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers were inkstained; tiny
voices chattered insanely.
Arthur looked up.
"Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script
for Hamlet they've worked out."




The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a
mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.
It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the
Galactic Government's research team on Damogran.
This, briefly, is the story of its discovery.
The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of
a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion
producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood - and such generators were often used
to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously
one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy.
Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand for this - partly because it was a
debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.
Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a
machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mindparalysing
distances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine
was virtually impossible.
Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party
found himself reasoning this way:
If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite
improbability. So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed
that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea ... and turn it on!
He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after
golden Infinite Improbability generator out of thin air.
It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme
Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the
one thing they really couldn't stand was a smartass.




The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a perfectly conventional
spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats hadn't had
the plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a
smallish restaurant. In fact it wasn't perfectly oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight
parallel curve, and all the angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes. The truth of the
matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary
three-dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have got miserable. As it was the cabin looked
excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on the
concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its
gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees. It too was fairly new,
but though it was beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more
or less humanoid body didn't quite fit properly. In fact they fitted perfectly well, but something in its
bearing suggested that they might have fitted better.
Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming
equipment and giggling with excitement.
Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off figures. Her voice was carried round the
Tannoy system of the whole ship.
"Five to one against and falling ..." she said, "four to one against and falling ... three to one ... two
... one ... probability factor of one to one ... we have normality, I repeat we have normality." She turned her
microphone off - then turned it back on, with a slight smile and continued: "Anything you still can't cope
with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon."
Zaphod burst out in annoyance: "Who are they Trillian?"
Trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged.
"Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space," she said. "Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha."
"Yeah, well that's a very sweet thought Trillian," complained Zaphod, "but do you really think it's
wise under the circumstances? I mean, here we are on the run and everything, we must have the police of
half the Galaxy after us by now, and we stop to pick up hitch hikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style, but
minus several million for good thinking, yeah?"
He tapped irritably at a control panel. Trillian quietly moved his hand before he tapped anything
important. Whatever Zaphod's qualities of mind might include - dash, bravado, conceit - he was mechanically
inept and could easily blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the
main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he never really understood the significance
of anything he did.
"Zaphod," she said patiently, "they were floating unprotected in open space ... you wouldn't want them to
have died would you?"
"Well, you know ... no. Not as such, but ..."
"Not as such? Not die as such? But?" Trillian cocked her head on one side.
"Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later."
"A second later and they would have been dead."
"Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a bit longer it would have gone away."
"You'd been happy to let them die?"
"Well, you know, not happy as such, but ..."
"Anyway," said Trillian, turning back to the controls, "I didn't pick them up."
"What do you mean? Who picked them up then?"
"The ship did."
"Huh?"
"The ship did. All by itself."
"Huh?"
"Whilst we were in Improbability Drive."
"But that's incredible."
"No Zaphod. Just very very improbable."
"Er, yeah."
"Look Zaphod," she said, patting his arm, "don't worry about the aliens. They're just a couple of guys I
expect. I'll send the robot down to get them and bring them up here. Hey Marvin!"
In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled
itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an outside
observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room. It stopped in front of Trillian and
seemed to stare through her left shoulder.
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said.
Its voice was low and hopeless.
"Oh God," muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat.
"Well," said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, "here's something to occupy you and keep your
mind off things."
"It won't work," droned Marvin, "I have an exceptionally large mind."
"Marvin!" warned Trillian.
"Alright," said Marvin, "what do you want me to do?"
"Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here under surveillance."
With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre - nothing you
could actually take offence at - Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human.
"Just that?" he said.
"Yes," said Trillian firmly.
"I won't enjoy it," said Marvin.
Zaphod leaped out of his seat.
"She's not asking you to enjoy it," he shouted, "just do it will you?"
"Alright," said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell, "I'll do it."
"Good ..." snapped Zaphod, "great ... thank you ..."
Marvin turned and lifted his flat-topped triangular red eyes up towards him.
"I'm not getting you down at all am I?" he said pathetically.
"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really ..."
"I wouldn't like to think that I was getting you down."
"No, don't worry about that," the lilt continued, "you just act as comes naturally and everything will be
just fine."
"You're sure you don't mind?" probed Marvin.
"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really ... just part of life."
"Marvin flashed him an electronic look.
"Life," said Marvin, "don't talk to me about life."
He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the
cabin. With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind
him
"I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod," growled Trillian.
The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of
a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as "Your Plastic Pal
Who's Fun To Be With."
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics
Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes,"
with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking
over the post of robotics correspondent.
Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a
time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics
Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came."
The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had sunk away to a better dimension. Ford
and Arthur found themselves in the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart.
"I think the ship's brand new," said Ford.
"How can you tell?" asked Arthur. "Have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal?"
"No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor. It's a lot of `the Universe can be yours' stuff. Ah!
Look, I was right."
Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur.
"It says: Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics. As soon as the ship's drive reaches
Infinite Improbability it passes through every point in the Universe. Be the envy of other major governments.
Wow, this is big league stuff."
Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally gasping with astonishment at
what he read - clearly Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his exile.
Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast majority of what Ford was
saying he began to let his mind wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible
computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit
up with the words Please do not press this button again. He shook himself.
"Listen," said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, "they make a big thing of the ship's
cybernetics. A new generation of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers, with the new
GPP feature."
"GPP feature?" said Arthur. "What's that?"
"Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities."
"Oh," said Arthur, "sounds ghastly."
A voice behind them said, "It is." The voice was low and hopeless and accompanied by a slight clanking
sound. They span round and saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway.
"What?" they said.
"Ghastly," continued Marvin, "it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don't even talk about it. Look at this
door," he said, stepping through it. The irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of
the sales brochure. "All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their
pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done."
As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied sigh-like
quality to it. "Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!" it said.
Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered with disgust and tinkered with the
concept of directing physical violence against it Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? What's the
point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the
molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids' brain cells. For a quick encore they measured the
level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom.
A spasm of despair shook the robot's body as he turned.
"Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a
planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't."
He turned and walked back to the hated door.
"Er, excuse me," said Ford following after him, "which government owns this ship?"
Marvin ignored him.
"You watch this door," he muttered, "it's about to open again. I can tell by the intolerable air of
smugness it suddenly generates."
With an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and Marvin stomped through.
"Come on," he said.
The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with pleased little clicks and whirrs.
"Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation," said Marvin and trudged
desolately up the gleaming curved corridor that stretched out before them. "Let's build robots with
Genuine People Personalities," they said. So they tried it out with me. I'm a personality prototype. You can
tell can't you?"
Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers.
"I hate that door," continued Marvin. "I'm not getting you down at all am I?"
"Which government ..." started Ford again.
"No government owns it," snapped the robot, "it's been stolen."
"Stolen?"
"Stolen?" mimicked Marvin.
"Who by?" asked Ford.
"Zaphod Beeblebrox."
Something extraordinary happened to Ford's face. At least five entirely separate and distinct expressions
of shock and amazement piled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid stride, seemed to
have difficulty in finding the floor again. He stared at the robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles.
"Zaphod Beeblebrox ...?" he said weakly.
"Sorry, did I say something wrong?" said Marvin, dragging himself on regardless. "Pardon me for
breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Here's
another of those self-satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to me about life."
"No one ever mentioned it," muttered Arthur irritably. "Ford, are you alright?"
Ford stared at him. "Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he said.




A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold cabin as Zaphod searched the sub-etha
radio wavebands for news of himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years radios had been
operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; then as the technology became more sophisticated
the controls were made touch-sensitive - you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers; now all you
had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of
muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening
to the same programme.
Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk music, but this time it was a
background to a news announcement. The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music.
"... and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band, broadcasting around the galaxy around
the clock," squawked a voice, "and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere ... and
to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news story
tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship by none other than Galactic
President Zaphod Beeblebrox. And the question everyone's asking is ... has the big Z finally flipped?
Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, ex-confidence trickster, once
described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One, and recently voted the Wort
Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known Universe for the seventh time ... has he got an answer this time? We
asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt ..." The music swirled and dived for a moment. Another
voice broke in, presumably Halfrunt. He said: "Vell, Zaphod's jist zis guy you know?" but got no further
because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radio's on/off sensitive airspace. Zaphod
turned and glared at Trillian - she had thrown the pencil.
"Hey," he said, what do you do that for?"
Trillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures.
"I've just thought of something," she said.
"Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?"
"You hear enough about yourself as it is."
"I'm very insecure. We know that."
"Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important."
"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now." Zaphod glared at
her again, then laughed.
"Listen," she said, "we picked up those couple of guys ..."
"What couple of guys?"
"The couple of guys we picked up."
"Oh, yeah," said Zaphod, "those couple of guys."
"We picked them up in sector ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha."
"Yeah?" said Zaphod and blinked.
Trillian said quietly, "Does that mean anything to you?"
"Mmmmm," said Zaphod, "ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha?"
"Well?" said Trillian.
"Er ... what does the Z mean?" said Zaphod.
"Which one?"
"Any one."
One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to
distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid
because he couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be
outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't understand what was going on, and really being
genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so - but not all the
time, which obviously worried him, hence the act. He proffered people to be puzzled rather than
contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be
bothered to argue about it.
She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she could make it simple for him, whatever
his reasons for wanting it to be that way.
"There," she pointed, "right there."
"Hey ... Yeah!" said Zaphod.
"Well?" she said.
"Well what?"
Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the inside of her head. She said, very calmly,
"It's the same sector you originally picked me up in."
He looked at her and then looked back at the screen.
"Hey, yeah," he said, "now that is wild. We should have zapped straight into the middle of the Horsehead
Nebula. How did we come to be there? I mean that's nowhere."
She ignored this.
"Improbability Drive," she said patiently. "You explained it to me yourself. We pass through every
point in the Universe, you know that."
"Yeah, but that's one wild coincidence isn't it?"
"Yes."
"Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the Universe to choose from? That's just too ...
I want to work this out. Computer!"
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which controlled and permeated every
particle of the ship switched into communication mode.
"Hi there!" it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of ticker tape just for the record.
The ticker tape said, Hi there!
"Oh God," said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for long but had already learned to loathe
it.
The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling detergent.
"I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help you solve it."
"Yeah yeah," said Zaphod. "Look, I think I'll just use a piece of paper."
"Sure thing," said the computer, spilling out its message into a waste bin at the same time, "I understand. If
you ever want ..."
"Shut up!" said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next to Trillian at the console.
"OK, OK ..." said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed down its speech channel again.
Zaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability flight path scanner flashed silently up in
front of them.
"Can we work out," said Zaphod, "from their point of view what the Improbability of their rescue was?"
"Yes, that's a constant", said Trillian, "two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand seven
hundred and nine to one against."
"That's high. They're two lucky lucky guys."
"Yes."
"But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up
..."
Trillian punched up the figures. They showed tow-to-the power-of-Infinity-minus-one (an irrational
number that only has a conventional meaning in Improbability physics).
"... it's pretty low," continued Zaphod with a slight whistle.
"Yes," agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically.
"That's one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for. Something pretty improbable has got to
show up on the balance sheet if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum."
Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the pencil away.
"Bat's dots, I can't work it out."
"Well?"
Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth.
"OK," he said. "Computer!"
The voice circuits sprang to life again.
"Why hello there!" they said (ticker tape, ticker tape). "All I want to do is make your day nicer and nicer
and nicer ..."
"Yeah well shut up and work something out for me."
"Sure thing," chattered the computer, "you want a probability forecast based on ..."
"Improbability data, yeah."
"OK," the computer continued. "Here's an interesting little notion. Did you realize that most people's
lives are governed by telephone numbers?"
A pained look crawled across one of Zaphod's faces and on to the other one.
"Have you flipped?" he said.
"No, but you will when I tell you that ..."
Trillian gasped. She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability flight path screen.
"Telephone number?" she said. "Did that thing say telephone number?"
Numbers flashed up on the screen.
The computer had paused politely, but now it continued.
"What I was about to say was that ..."
"Don't bother please," said Trillian.
"Look, what is this?" said Zaphod.
"I don't know," said Trillian, "but those aliens - they're on the way up to the bridge with that wretched
robot. Can we pick them up on any monitor cameras?"




Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning.
"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side ..."
"No?" said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. "Really?"
"Oh yes," said Marvin, "I mean I've asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens."
"I can imagine."
Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. "Well well well," he kept saying to
himself, "Zaphod Beeblebrox ..."
Suddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand.
"You know what's happened now of course?"
"No, what?" said Arthur, who didn't what to know.
"We've arrived at another of those doors."
There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor.
Marvin eyed it suspiciously.
"Well?" said Ford impatiently. "Do we go through?"
"Do we go through?" mimicked Marvin. "Yes. This is the entrance to the bridge. I was told to take you to
the bridge. Probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today I shouldn't
wonder."
Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a hunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid
open.
"Thank you," it said, "for making a simple door very happy."
Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground.
"Funny," he intoned funerally, "how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly
does."
He heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur staring at each other and shrugging their
shoulders. From inside they heard Marvin's voice again.
"I suppose you want to see the aliens now," he said. "Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just
fall apart where I'm standing?"
"Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin?" came another voice.
Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing.
"What's ...?"
"Shhh," said Ford, "come in."
He stepped through into the bridge.
Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling back in a chair with his feet
on a control console picking the teeth in his right-hand head with his left hand. The right-hand head seemed
to be thoroughly preoccupied with this task, but the left-hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed,
nonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn't believe he was seeing was fairly large. His jaw
flapped about at a loose end for a while.
The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling affectation of nonchalance said, "Ford,
hi, how are you? Glad you could drop in."
Ford was not going to be outcooled.
"Zaphod," he drawled, "great to see you, you're looking well, the extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've
stolen."
Arthur goggled at him.
"You mean you know this guy?" he said, waving a wild finger at Zaphod.
"Know him!" exclaimed Ford, "he's ..." he paused, and decided to do the introductions the other way
round.
"Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent," he said, "I saved him when his planet blew up."
"Oh sure," said Zaphod, "hi Arthur, glad you could make it." His right-hand head looked round casually,
said "hi" and went back to having his teeth picked.
Ford carried on. "And Arthur," he said, "this is my semi-cousin Zaphod Beeb ..."
"We've met," said Arthur sharply.
When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard driving cars
and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from fourth to first instead
of third thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off your
stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect off his.
"Err ... what?"
"I said we've met."
Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply.
"Hey ... er, have we? Hey ... er ..."
Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he felt he was back on home ground he
suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as much about the
affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life in Peking.
"What do you mean you've met?" he demanded. "This is Zaphod Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you
know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon."
"I don't care," said Arthur coldly. We've met, haven't we Zaphod Beeblebrox - or should I say ... Phil?"
"What!" shouted Ford.
"You'll have to remind me," said Zaphod. "I've a terrible memory for species."
"It was at a party," pursued Arthur.
"Yeah, well I doubt that," said Zaphod.
"Cool it will you Arthur!" demanded Ford.
Arthur would not be deterred. "A party six months ago. On Earth ... England ..."
Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile.
"London," insisted Arthur, "Islington."
"Oh," said Zaphod with a guilty start, "that party."
This wasn't fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards between Arthur and Zaphod. "What?"
he said to Zaphod. "You don't mean to say you've been on that miserable planet as well do you?"
"No, of course not," said Zaphod breezily. "Well, I may have just dropped in briefly, you know, on my way
somewhere ..."
"But I was stuck there for fifteen years!"
"Well I didn't know that did I?"
"But what were you doing there?"
"Looking about, you know."
"He gatecrashed a party," persisted Arthur, trembling with anger, "a fancy dress party ..."
"It would have to be, wouldn't it?" said Ford.
"At this party," persisted Arthur, "was a girl ... oh well, look it doesn't matter now. The whole place
has gone up in smoke anyway ..."
"I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet," said Ford.
"Who was the lady?"
"Oh just somebody. Well alright, I wasn't doing very well with her. I'd been trying all evening. Hell, she
was something though. Beautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I'd got her to myself for a bit
and was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours barges up and says Hey doll, is this guy
boring you? Why don't you talk to me instead? I'm from a different planet." I never saw her again."
"Zaphod?" exclaimed Ford.
"Yes," said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. "He only had the two arms and the
one head and he called himself Phil, but ..."
"But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet," said Trillian wandering into sight at
the other end of the bridge. She gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks and
then turned her attention to the ship's controls again.
There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled mess of Arthur's brain crawled
some words.
"Tricia McMillian?" he said. "What are you doing here?"
"Same as you," she said, "I hitched a lift. After all with a degree in Maths and another in astrophysics
what else was there to do? It was either that or the dole queue again on Monday."
"Infinity minus one," chattered the computer, "Improbability sum now complete."
Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian.
"Trillian," he said, "is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the Improbability drive?"
"Very probably, I'm afraid," she said.
