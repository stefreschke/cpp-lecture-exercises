// There are cells and particles: each cell is initialized
// with a certain quota of energy of the overall energy g_energy.
// When a cell has a high energy level, it is more likeley to
// spawn particles and thereby randomly distributing its own energy
// to the particles...
// The particles get a random life time (tod), random position
// within the cell, a random velocity as well as the random energy
// quota from the cell.
// The particle then moves until time of death (tod) is reached.
// The particle then passes its energy quota back to its underlying
// cell. Theryby cells are reloaded again and again and a cylce is
// closed, causing continuous particle spawning...
